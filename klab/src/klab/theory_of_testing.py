    !restructure tests around stateÂ¡
    use full setUp tearDown symmetry
    test methods become shared pivots
    around whatever you care to track
    
    ~~ everything must have a name ~~
    that thing you get back from a function?
    name it -> everything must have a name
    name = classify = type = consider

    at the very least it is [something]_object
    EVERYTHING in python is at least an object
    if you can't name the object you're wielding,
    then the object is wielding you

    -limit the unconfidence horizon
    -verify robust first principles
    -specify, formalize, ontologize
    -if appropriate -> tell a story
    -use custom test result, runner
    -easy to run - editor and shell

    monkey like complicated?
    NO!
    MONKEY LIKE SIMPLE
    want do EVERY day?
    make simple

ONTOLOGY
-concepts and how they relate to each other
-fundamental entities and their definitions
->achieve clarity about what exists in code

    // 95% confidence in a line of code //
    // ----- and its consequences ---- //
    // ----- and its weaknesses ----- //
    //       10 lines -> 60%         //
    //       20 lines -> 36%        //
