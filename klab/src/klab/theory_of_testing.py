    ???
    structure tests around state
    use full setUp tearDown symmetry
    test methods become shared pivots
    around whatever you care to track

    ???
    functions are objects like relays
    state changes by functional flows

    ???
    function -> noun
    TestCase -> synonyms

    EVERYTHING in python is at least an object
    so at the very least ANYTHING is an object
    consider what state it transforms and how
    what kind of object is it? SOMETHING_object

    -verify robust first principles
    -specify, formalize, ontologize
    -if appropriate -> tell a story
    -use custom test result, runner
    -easy to run - editor and shell

    monkey like complicated?
    NO!
    MONKEY LIKE SIMPLE
    wanna do EVERY day?
    make do simple

ONTOLOGY
-concepts and how they relate to each other
-fundamental entities and their definitions
->achieve clarity about what exists in code

    // 95% confidence in a line of code //
    // ----- and its consequences ---- //
    // ----- and its weaknesses ----- //
    //       10 lines -> 60%         //
    //       20 lines -> 36%        //
    //       100 lines -> 0%       //
    // -------------------------- //
    // hack hack hack hack hack h //
    // employ repl, docs, machete //
    // achieve precise transforms //
    // with basic data structures //
    // and then begin engineering //
    // -------------------------- //
    // when knowledge is adequate //
    // functions emerge naturally //
    // from within tests or specs //
